Design pattern exercise


You have to design the business logic of a Starbucks­ like cafeteria.  
Specifically, you have to design the code responsible for preparing beverages (i.e. 
Single shot espresso, Cappuccino, Tea, Milkshakes). 


Each beverage is prepared following a sequence of common steps, such as: 
○ Taking a cup where the beverage will be prepared 
○ Pouring the main liquid (for example, water for the tea, hot coffee for the 
espresso, milk for the milkshakes) 
○ Adding some beverage ­specific ingredients (for example, the tea bag for the tea, 
the milk foam for cappuccino, etc.) 
○ Adding sugar 
○ Serve the cup to the client 
 
Which design pattern(s) would you use to model this scenario?  
Justify your decision.
